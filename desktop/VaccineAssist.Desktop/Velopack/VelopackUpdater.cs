/// <summary>
/// Velopack self-update check/download, wired as a fire-and-forget call
/// from App.xaml.cs.OnStartup AFTER the existing startup work (see that
/// call site) — never awaited there, never blocking launch, every
/// exception caught here and logged rather than propagated.
///
/// LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT: <see cref="CheckAndApplyAsync"/> returns
/// immediately unless the running copy was actually installed by
/// Setup.exe/vpk (see <paramref name="isInstalledOverride"/> below and
/// <see cref="IsInstalled"/>). That is false for BOTH:
///   - a plain `dotnet build`/F5 run from a checkout (no Velopack install
///     metadata on disk), and
///   - the EXISTING update-and-run.ps1 + desktop-shortcut flow, which is
///     just a `dotnet publish` output copied to a folder and launched
///     directly — never run through Setup.exe/vpk.
/// This is what keeps that whole existing path 100% Velopack-free with no
/// build-time #if/#define branching needed: the exact same binary quietly
/// no-ops here when it wasn't installed the new way, satisfying Will's
/// hard requirement (G-Q5): "It is vital that the vaccine app is not
/// interrupted." Program.cs's unconditional VelopackApp.Build().Run() call
/// is separately safe for the same reason (Velopack detects "not
/// installed" internally there too) — this class's own gate is what stops
/// THIS code from ever touching S3/the network on that path.
///
/// NOTE ON THE GATE'S NAME: the approved plan describes this as
/// "VelopackRuntimeInfo.IsInstalled" — that member does not exist in the
/// Velopack package actually pinned here (1.2.161; verified against
/// github.com/velopack/velopack at that tag — VelopackRuntimeInfo has no
/// IsInstalled property). The equivalent, documented member is the
/// INSTANCE property <c>UpdateManager.IsInstalled</c>
/// (<c>Locator.CurrentlyInstalledVersion != null</c>), used here instead —
/// same invariant, correct API.
